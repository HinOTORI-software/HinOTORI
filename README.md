HinOTORI Control softwares
==========================
HinOTORI is a project to develop a new robotic telescope with 3 colours simultaneous imaging system in Tibet. The software package enables the telescope system to be robotic.

Once you run "LaunchAlluna.bat" on a windows machine, then you can control TCS, cameras with client softwares outside if you make network connections appropriately.

The process communication is established by Internet Communication Engine (ICE). This middleware is based on Sun Remote Procedure Call.
